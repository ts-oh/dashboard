## Lessons/Comments

This project involved learning how to fetch data from an API. But it also involved incorporating multiple lessons from other projects. Some of the concepts that were included were the use of factory functions to return variables and methods as an object and using modules to separate parts into components. 

Furthermore, the DOM elements were created through the use of JavaScript. Overall learning about asynchronous function to fetch data from API was fascinating. Also separating different parts of the app through modules and creating each part through factory function was very enjoyable as it made the code organised and easier to debug.
